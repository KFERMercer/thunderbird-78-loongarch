Disclaimer: The original upstream tarball is modified from upstream by
 removing a set of sourceless binary, non-free, and VCS-related files. You
 can find a repack.py script in the debian directory doing this cleanup,
 using filtering data present in a source.filter file in the same directory.
 If this file is incomplete, which I'm pretty sure is the case, because it's
 difficult not to forget anything in this huge amount of data, please file
 a bug or contact me.
 Some licensing terms are not included verbatim in this file on purpose, for
 terms that are available in a file in subdirectories that are not used to
 build the binary packages.

 .
                              ---------------
 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
    1.1. "Contributor" means each entity that creates or contributes to
         the creation of Modifications.
 .
    1.2. "Contributor Version" means the combination of the Original
         Code, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the
         Modifications made by that particular Contributor.
 .
    1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the
         combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each
         case including portions thereof.
 .
    1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism
         generally accepted in the software development community for
         the electronic transfer of data.
 .
    1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source
         Code.
 .
    1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified
         as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by
         Exhibit A.
 .
    1.7. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or
         portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this
         License.
 .
    1.8. "License" means this document.
 .
    1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the
         substance or structure of either the Original Code or any
         previous Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a
         series of files, a Modification is:
 .
        A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
           containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

           or previous Modifications.
 .
    1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
          which is described in the Source Code notice required by

          governed by this License.
 .
    1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
          making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,
          plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used
          to control compilation and installation of an Executable, or a
          list of source code differential comparisons against either
          the Original Code or another well known, available Covered
          Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a
          compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate
          decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for
          no charge.
 .
    1.12. "You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
          under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License

    The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
    claims:
      (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
          distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
          without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
      (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
          Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell
          ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but
          solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
          necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or
          portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
          necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
 .
    2.2. Contributor Grant.
    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
    property claims:
      (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
          sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such
          Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified
          basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of
          a Larger Work; and
      (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
          Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
          thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
          reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
          Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent
          that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
          combinations.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
    3.1. Application of License.
    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
    Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
    include an additional document offering the additional rights
    described in Section 3.5.
 .
    3.2. Availability of Source Code.
    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
    either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
    Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
    (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
    least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
    Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
    responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
    maintained by a third party.
 .
    3.3. Description of Modifications.
    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain
    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
    that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
    Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in
    any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
    which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
      (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
          property right in particular functionality or code (or its
          utilization under this License), you must include a text file
          with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
          describes the claim and the party making the claim in
          sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
          If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification
          available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
          modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
          thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
          appropriate comm/mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
          to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
          knowledge has been obtained.
      (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming interface
          and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
          to implement that API, you must also include this information
          in the LEGAL file.
 .
    3.5. Required Notices.
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your
    name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it
    is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
    due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a
    location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be
    likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
    charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
    may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
    included in any notice in an Executable version, related
    documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
    rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
    Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,
    which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
    You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
    license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
    rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
    version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
    that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
    alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
    any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
    as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
    3.7. Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
    Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
    included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
    included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
    be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
    able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
    6.1. New Versions.
    Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
    and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
    6.2. Effect of New Versions.
    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
 .
    6.3. Derivative Works.
    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you
    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your
    license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",
    "Netscape", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
    anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your
    version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla
    Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of
    the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
    described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
    modifications of this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
    THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
    shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
    License shall survive.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
    CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
    ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR

    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
    terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only

    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
    of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the
    United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing,

    Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
    County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
    including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
    fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention

    excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
    a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
    to this License.
 .

    Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
