#
# Note about GECKO_HEAD_REV and GECKO_HEAD_REF:
# GECKO_HEAD_REF is a branch name or "default".
# GECKO_HEAD_REV is a revision hash. It cannot be a symbolic name like "default"
# or "THUNDERBIRD_60_VERBRANCH".
#
# comm-central will have GECKO_HEAD_REF defined as "default" but not
# GECKO_HEAD_REV. Release branches are pinned to a particular commit
# and set GECKO_HEAD_REV. They may also set GECKO_HEAD_REF when the pinned
# commit is in a branch within the repository, such as THUNDERBIRD_60_VERBRANCH.
