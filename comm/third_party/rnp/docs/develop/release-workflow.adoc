= Releases

== General Notes

* Avoid tagging commits in the `master` branch.
* Release branches should have annotated tags and a CHANGELOG.md.
* The steps below detail creation of a brand new 1.0.0 release.
  Some steps would be omitted for minor releases.

== Creating an Initial Release

=== Update the Documentation

Update references to version numbers in relevant documentation to the new
version you intend to release.

[source,console]
--
git checkout master
vim docs/installation.adoc
git add docs/installation.adoc
git commit
git push
--

=== Create the Branch

Release branches have names of the form `release/N.x`, where N is the major
version (and x is a literal -- not a placeholder).

[source,console]
--
git checkout -b release/1.x master
--

[[update-changelog-and-version]]
=== Update CHANGELOG and version

[source,console]
--
vim CHANGELOG.md
# Add/update CHANGELOG entry for the new version
git add CHANGELOG.md

echo 1.0.0 > version.txt
git add -f version.txt

git commit
--

=== Create a Tag

An initial release would be tagged as follows:

[source,console]
--
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m ''
--

=== Push

[source,console]
--
# push the branch
git push origin release/1.x

# push the tag
git push origin v1.0.0
--

== Creating a New Release

Maintaining a release branch involves cherry-picking hotfixes and similar commits
from the `master` branch, while following the rules for Semantic Versioning.

The steps below will show the release of version 1.0.1.

=== Add the Desired Changes

Cherry-pick the appropriate commits into the appropriate `release/N.x` branch.

To see what commits are in `master` that are not in the release branch, you
can observe the lines starting with `+` in:

[source,console]
--
git cherry -v release/1.x master
--

It is often useful to pick a range of commits. For example:

[source,console]
--
git checkout release/0.x
git cherry-pick a57b36f^..e23352c
--

If there are merge commits in this range, this will not work. Instead, try:

[source,console]
--
git checkout release/0.x
git cherry release/0.x master | grep '^+ ' | cut -c 3-9 | while read commit; do git cherry-pick $commit; done
--

From here, you can follow the steps for an initial release,
starting with link:#update-changelog-and-version[Update CHANGELOG and version].
