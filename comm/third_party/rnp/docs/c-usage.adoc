= Using RNP’s C APIs

If you’re a developer and wish to use the RNP library in your projects,
you can use the examples below to see how it may be done.

== Samples

[TIP]
.Where to find the examples
====
Find the source code for these examples
under `https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/[src/examples]`.

If you’re building from source, the examples are built together with the RNP library
and are available in `src/examples` directory of your build folder.
====

[TIP]
====
All samples below use APIs exposed via header file
`https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/include/rnp/rnp.h[include/rnp/rnp.h]`,
check it out for more documentation.
====

Following sample applications are available:

`generate`:: Includes code which shows how to generate keys, save/load keyrings, export keys.

`encrypt`:: Includes code which shows how to encrypt file, using the password and/or key.

`decrypt`:: This one shows how to decrypt OpenPGP data, using the key or password.

`sign`:: Shows how to sign messages, using the key(s) from loaded keyring.

`verify`:: Shows how to verify signed messages using dynamic keys fetching (sample key provider implementation).

`dump`:: Shows how to dump OpenPGP packet information.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/generate.c[generate.c]

This example is composed from 2 functions:

 * `ffi_generate_keys()`: this shows how to generate and save different key types
   (RSA and EDDSA/Curve25519) using the JSON key description.
   This also demonstrates the usage of password provider.
+
Keyrings will be saved to files `pubring.pgp` and `secring.pgp` in the current directory.
You can use `rnp --list-packets pubring.pgp` to check the properties of the generated key(s).

 * `ffi_output_keys()`: This shows how to load keyrings,
   search for the keys (in helper functions `ffi_print_key()`/`ffi_export_key()`),
   and export them to memory or file in armored format.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/encrypt.c[encrypt.c]

This code sample first loads public keyring (`pubring.pgp`) (created by the “generate.c” example),
then creates encryption operation structure and configures it with various options
(including the setup of password encryption and public-key encryption).

The result is the encrypted and armored (for easier reading) message `RNP encryption sample message`.
It is saved to the file `encrypted.asc` in current directory.

You can investigate it via the `rnp --list-packets encrypted.asc` command.
Also, you may want to decrypt saved file via `rnp --keyfile secring.pgp -d encrypted.asc`.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/decrypt.c[decrypt.c]

This example uses keyrings generated in the “generate.c” sample to decrypt messages
encrypted by the “encrypt.c” sample.

It shows how to decrypt message with password or with a key
and implements custom password provider for decryption or key password.

Decrypted message is saved to the memory and then printed to the stdout.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/sign.c[sign.c]

This sample uses keyrings generated in the preceding “generate.c” sample.

This sample configures signing context and signs the message, saving it to the `signed.asc` file.
Attached signature is used, i.e. the data is encapsulated into the resulting message.

You can investigate the signed message by issuing `rnp --list-packets signed.asc` command.
To verify message, use `rnp --keyfile pubring.pgp -v signed.asc`.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/verify.c[verify.c]

This example uses keyrings generated in the “generate.c” sample.

However, instead of loading the whole keyring, it implements dynamic key fetching
via custom key provider (see function `example_key_provider`).

After verification this sample outputs the verified embedded message
and all signatures with signing key ids and statuses.

=== https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/blob/master/src/examples/dump.c[dump.c]

This example dumps OpenPGP packet information from the input stream (stdin or filename), 
tuned with flags passed via command line interface.

Resulting human-readable text or JSON is dumped to stdout.
